Let Man[1:n] and Woman[1:n] arrays of processes. Each man ranks the women from 1 to n, and each woman ranks the men from 1 to n. (A ranking is a permutation of integers from 1 to n). A pairing is a one-to-one correspondence between men and women. A pairing is stable if, for two men, Man[i] and   Man[j], and their paired women, Woman[p] and  Woman[q], both of the following conditions are satisfied:

Man[i] ranks Woman[p] higher than Woman[q], or Woman[q] ranks Man[j] higher than Man[i]; and
Man[j] ranks Woman[q] higher than Woman[p], or Woman[p] ranks Man[i] higher than Man[j].
A solution to the stable marriage problem is a set of n pairings, all of which are stable.

Assume that the processes are distributed and can interact by message passing. Develop a distributed peer-to-peer application to solve the stable marriage problem. The men should propose, and the women should listen. A woman has to accept the first proposal she gets because a better one might not come along; however, she can dump (leave) the first man if she later gets a better proposal. [Hint: To terminate, the program needs to count the number of women that have ever accepted a proposal. This could be achieved with an extra counter process or a global variable.] You can implement your distributed application in C using the MPI library. Your program should print a trace of the interesting events as they happen, but do not make the trace too verbose.


Define Preferences: The menPreferences and womenPreferences arrays are defined globally to store the preferences of each man and woman. You can modify these arrays to reflect different preferences.

Track Proposals: The proposals array is used to keep track of which women have been proposed to by each man. Initialize this array to zero.

Man's Logic:

Use MPI_Send to send proposals to women.
Iterate through the man's preferences and propose to each woman in order.
Update the proposals array to keep track of proposals.
Woman's Logic:

Use MPI_Recv to receive proposals from men.
Compare incoming proposals with the current partner (if any).
Accept the proposal if it is better than the current partner, otherwise reject it.
Use MPI_Send to send acceptance or rejection messages back to men.
Termination Condition:

Implement a termination condition to check when all pairings are stable.
This might involve counting the number of women who have accepted proposals and ensuring no further proposals are needed.
By following these hints and implementing the necessary logic, you can develop a distributed peer-to-peer application to solve the stable marriage problem using MPI.
